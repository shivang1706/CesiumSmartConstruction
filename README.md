Project for Smart Construction


Steps to reproduce:

1) Go to the project target folder
2) run npm install
3) Some of the npm modules might not work like: 
   a) npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome, 
   b) npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
   c) npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
   d) npm i uuidv4
Manually install it

4) npm start
5) Add the materials
6) Select any material from the left and delete it.



Time used for above implementation: 3 and half hours

What was not achieved? 1) The total cost feature could not be completed.
